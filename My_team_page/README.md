## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/previews/desktop.png)

A basic page showing the members of the team using HTML and CSS from the Responsive Web Developer path.

- **Where can you see my demo?**

  The demo is live at [https://my-team-page-wine.vercel.app](https://my-team-page-wine.vercel.app).

- **What was my experience?**

  I took up this project as an opportunity to reinforce knowledge of HTML and CSS using the grid system.

- **What have I learned/improved?**

  I have learnt to use the grid system better to make team members because some are at different heights/levels.
